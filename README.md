# EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_XX

## General Infos

1. Assign yourself to a [**Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=367938), even if you are working alone.
1. If you are working in a group of two, you may not divide tasks between you! **All group members must be involved in all tasks and in all videos!** 
1. **Download** (not clone) this git repo, **really unzip** it (right click, extract, ...) and **rename the unpacked folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`. 
1. Edit the provided Jupyter notebooks containing the exercises and answer the questions directly in them. Add additional code and markdown cells as needed. It is not necessary to create new notebooks!
1. Just providing code is not enough! **Describe shortly** what you are doing! Use **markdown cells** with **appropriate formatting** (headers, lists, typesetting of equations, etc.) in your Jupyter Notebooks to explain your steps. Use short comments in your code cells, too.
1. After you have completed the tasks, zip the directory with your code and data and upload the zip file to moodle. The upload link will be announced later.  
1. Present your work in the form of **videos**. Imagine you would explain it to other course members. 


3. Create **your own HSRW gitlab repo** from it and make it **PRIVATE** to avoid copy and paste from others. It is enough if **one member of the group provides the group repo**. The owner of the repo can invite the other group members to collaborate and to grant push rights to them.
4. **Strictly follow the naming conventions for your HSRW gitlab group repo!** At due date the supervisors will search for the repo names and download them. If you choose another name we will not be able to find the repo: it is as if you had not submitted your assignment.
