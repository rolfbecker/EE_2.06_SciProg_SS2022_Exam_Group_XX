## General Infos

1. Due date is **2022-08-31**.
1. You can withdraw from the exam up to one week before the exam.
1. You can work in groups of two students or alone.
1. Assign yourself to a [**SciProg SS2022 Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=367938), even if you are working alone.
1. If you are working in a group of two, you may not divide tasks between you! **All group members must be involved in all tasks and in all videos!** 
1. **Download** (not clone) this git repo, **really unzip** it (right click, extract, ...) and **rename the unpacked folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`. 
1. **Edit the provided Jupyter notebooks** containing the exercises and answer the questions directly in them. Add additional code and markdown cells as needed. It is not necessary to create new notebooks!
1. **Do not use pocket calculators or spreadsheet programs!** Do all your calculations explicitly in the Jupyter notebooks! Otherwise we will deduct points for this. 
1. Just providing code is not enough! **Describe shortly** what you are doing! Use **markdown cells** with **appropriate formatting** (headers, lists, typesetting of equations, etc.) in your Jupyter Notebooks to explain your steps. Use short comments in your code cells, too.
1. Present your work in the form of **videos** and explain the Jupyter notebooks. Imagine you would present it to other course members. The video production is Task 03. **Do NOT take video recordings from your computer screen with your smartphone!** Use professional **screencast software** such as OBS or similar!
1. After you have completed the tasks, zip the directory with your code and data and **upload the zip file to Moodle.**
1. **Just one group member should upload** the report to save space on Moodle. 
<br>The upload area will be published in the [**SciProg SS2022 Moodle Course**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/course/view.php?id=15216).
