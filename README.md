# EE_2.06_SciProg_SS202S_Exam_Group_XX

## General Infos

1. Assign yourself to a [**Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=308419), even if you are working alone.
1. Download (not clone) this repo and **rename the folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`. 
1. Create **your own HSRW gitlab repo** from it and make it **PRIVATE** to avoid copy and paste from others. It is enough if **one member of the group provides the group repo**. The owner of the repo can invite the other group members to collaborate and to grant push rights to them.
1. **Strictly follow the naming conventions for your HSRW gitlab group repo!** At due date the supervisors will search for the repo names and download them. If you choose another name we will not be able to find the repo: it is as if you had not submitted your assignment.
1. Describe shortly what you are doing! Just providing code is not enough! **Use markdown cells and appropriate formatting** to add your descriptive text.
