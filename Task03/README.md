# Task 03: Produce short videos explaining your work.

Produce short videos explaining your work using your Jupyter notebooks. Save the videos in the local subfolder [videos](./videos/). They will be part of the zip file you upload to Moodle.

**Do NOT take video recordings from your computer screen with your smartphone!** Use professional screencast software such as OBS or similar.

In case the videos become too large Moodle would refuse the file to be uploaded. Then we have to find another way, e.g. providing a sciebo upload area.
