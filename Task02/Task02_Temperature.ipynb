    "Warming stripes (sometimes referred to as climate stripes, climate timelines or stripe graphics) are data visualization graphics that use a series of coloured stripes chronologically ordered to visually portray long-term temperature trends. Warming stripes reflect a \"minimalist\" tyle, conceived to use colour alone to avoid technical distractions and intuitively convey global warming trends to non-scientists. \n",
